## WarAngel's plugin scripts created for his EQEmu
>
###  wa_Plugin.pl
> With this .pl you just drop it in your .../directory/plugins...
sub scripts inside the plugin is listed below with description and instructions if needed.

* wa_Decisions
    > Narrative soon...
* wa_ChatMode
    > Narrative soon...
* wa_KillMode
    > You can input a minimum and a maximum distance for the kill "area".
* wa_NameGenerator
    > You will see where there are pieces of names (syllables). Dependiing on gender and race_ID insert your own name elements. For example..."Legolas"...break in down to "Leg ol as". Now you will see many codes such as... (4 => [1,'Mith Mar Murn Menth Mic','ol ea el','as ere as cha'],).
    
    > In that code in the [ ] there are three "areas" called arrays. Divided by the "," with elements inside (Mith Mar Murn...) In this case you have the first array with the first syllable of a name... "Mith". The second array with a second syllable of "ol". And the third with "as" for a name of Mitholas. Now breaking a name down gives a random generated name in game! Again could have Mitholas or Mithelere or Murneacha...
* wa_ChangeName
    > Changes the NPCs name after recieving it from the wa_NameGenerator.
* wa_RandomGender (coming soon)
    > Just as it says 50/50 chance of being a guy or a girl.
    > 
More to come...

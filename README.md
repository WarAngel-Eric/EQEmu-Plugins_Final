    > Below you will see where there are pieces of names (syllables). Dependiing on gender and race_ID insert your own name elements. For example..."Legolas"...break in down to "Leg ol as". Now below you will see many codes such as... (4 => [1,'Mith Mar Murn Menth Mic','ol ea el','as ere as cha'],) In that code in the [] ther are three "areas" called arrays. Divided by the "," with elements inside (Mith Mar Murn...) In this case you have the first array with the first syllable of a name... "Mith". The second array with a second syllable of "ol". And the third with "as" for a name of Mitholas. Now breaking a name down gives a random generated name in game! Again could have Mitholas or Mithelere or Murneacha...
